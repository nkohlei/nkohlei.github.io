    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      This website serves as a testing ground for preliminary concepts, 
      drawing inspiration from Tesla's innovative designs for electric vehicles. 
      The project is still in its early stages, and I require time to further 
      develop and refine it. My goal is to expand my knowledge and experience 
      during this process, ultimately delivering more comprehensive and practical 
      solutions. The content on this site represents initial ideas and designs, 
      which may be updated with more advanced versions as the project evolves.
